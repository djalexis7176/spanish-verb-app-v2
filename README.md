A simple web app for learning Spanish vocabulary


I am currently interested in making very simple apps that serve a singular purpose. **Spanish Verb App** is meant to only teach spanish verbs for travelers visiting mexico.  So it will concentrate on basics of words that would be logical for this purpose and will focus on Mexican uses as opposed to Spanish from Spain or Spanish in South America.  __The App will be renamed once it is presentable__. I do not speak spanish but I am creating the app to help me and others learn.  The app will start with verbs ending in _**ar**_ and will expand to make the lessons more fun and interactive.  It will then add verbs ending in _**er**_ and _**ir**_ using the same amount of pages and quizzes and words.  

I have hit a glitch I have been unable to figure out where :
## __Glitches__
* Sometimes the english to spanish button only changes one word into english
* The quiz that comes after the first grid shows no words some of the time
* The grid quiz at the end marks any submission is incorrect ( it is supposed to let you go to the next lesson after you fill in the column for that lesson correctly)
